\chapter*{Conclusion}

A computational approach to protein folding is an important area intensely studied for more than 3 decades. In this thesis project, we built our pipeline extracting information about the evolutionary relationship between proteins. We successfully generated the input data by careful cooperation of several programs. Then we trained a deep convolutional neural network that predicted inter-residue distance distributions as well as secondary structure and torsion angles. The performance of the model was evaluated on an independent test set of 500 domains. The residue-residue contact precision as well as the secondary structure prediction is as good as current methods. In the last step, we developed our algorithm for structure optimization, but in the end, we used a third party software CONFOLD2. Our structures are not as good as the ones produced by the best teams at CASP, however, there is clear potential and a lot of room for improvement.
